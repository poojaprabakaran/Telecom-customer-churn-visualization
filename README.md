# Telecom-customer-churn-visualization
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer churn data to identify key factors influencing customer retention and attrition. Using Tableau, multiple interactive dashboards were created to visualize customer demographics, service usage, and financial patterns that contribute to churn behavior.

Objectives

* Understand patterns in customer churn across different segments.

* Identify relationships between tenure, monthly charges, and churn rate.

* Visualize the impact of contract type, payment method, and internet service on customer retention.

* Support data-driven decisions to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes information about telecom customers, their account details, and whether they have churned or not.
Key fields used:

* Customer ID
* Gender
* Senior Citizen
* Partner / Dependents
* Tenure
* Internet Service
* Contract Type
* Payment Method
* Monthly Charges / Total Charges
* Churn (Yes/No)

Dashboards Created
1. Customer Profile

Focuses on the demographic characteristics of customers.

* Gender and Senior Citizen vs Churn
* Dependents vs Churn
* Partner and Multiple Line distribution

Insight:
Senior citizens and customers without dependents or partners show higher churn rates, highlighting vulnerability among specific demographic segments.

2. Services and Contract

Analyzes how different service types and contracts impact churn.

* Internet Service and Phone Service patterns
* Paperless Billing vs Churn
* Contract Type and Payment Method analysis

Insight:
Customers with month-to-month contracts and paperless billing have higher churn. Fiber optic users also show a greater tendency to leave compared to DSL users.

3. Financial & Tenure Analysis

Explores customer tenure, billing behavior, and churn correlation.

* Tenure distribution and churn rate by tenure
* Total Charges vs Tenure
* Monthly Charges distribution and churn comparison
* Contract Type vs Billing Type

Insight:
Customers with shorter tenure and higher monthly bills are more likely to churn. Long-term contract holders exhibit stronger retention and lower churn rates.
